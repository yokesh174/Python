PYTHON PROGRAMMING

--->VARIABLES
             Variables in Python are symbolic names that refer to objects in memory
Ex:
   a=10
   b=10
   print(a+b)
output:
   20
Here the a and b are the variables

--->DATATYPES 
            Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. 
            It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data

Ex 1:
   a=10
   print(type(a))
output:
     <class 'int'>

Ex 2:
   a="yoki"
   print(type(a))
output:
    <class 'str'>

like that there are so many datatypes are there such as integer , string, float etc....


--->OPERATORS
            Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

Ex:

  a=10
  b=20
  c=a+b
  print(c)
output:
    30

here the addtion symbol is an opertor. like that so many operators are there such as +,-,*,% etc..
